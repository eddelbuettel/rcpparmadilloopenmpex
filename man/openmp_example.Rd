\usage{
openmp_example()
}
\description{
This example is taken directly from the Armadillo documentation.
When built with OpenMP support, and running on a system with
multiple cores, R will likely complain about 'CPU time > 2 elapsed
time'. However, when environment variable 'SHOWME' is set to 'yes'
we throttle and no warning appears.
